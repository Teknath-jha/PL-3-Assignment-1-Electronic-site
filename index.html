                <h3>Why Blockchain Is Important In 2021 And Beyond</h3>
                <p>This article discusses all the reasons why blockchain is important, based on different practical real-life use cases in different sectors.

                    Have you ever wondered why blockchain is important? Or maybe you have asked how it is going to impact our daily life or the lives of different professionals working in different sectors.

                    In this article, we are going to focus on the importance of blockchain technology, not only in real-life scenarios,
                    but also its importance in business or banks.
                    Blockchain is now very popular among the general audience. Its popularity started with the rise of bitcoin prices.
                    However, right now, its popularity, according to Google, is now settling down.<br>
                    
                    Blockchain is immutable. This opens a lot of opportunities for platforms that need immutable traits to make their 
                    system more functional in a highly competitive market. Take the supply chain, for example. Immutability enables 
                    companies to ensure that there is no hamper done to the packages in transit. As blockchain is immutable, it is not
                    possible to alter the package information in any way. Any alteration will alarm the system.<br>
                    
                    As a human being, one of your rights is freedom. There are centralized entities that offer connectivity in terms of 
                    economy but also take away our freedom. Take your bank, for example. It can block your transactions or confiscate
                    your account if deemed right. There are banks that do so — even when the account holders have not done anything 
                    wrong. So, if you are taking blockchain into account, you will find there is no centralized authority.</p>

                <h3>Building trust and boosting the bottom line</h3>
                <p>
                    Blockchain for business uses a shared and immutable ledger that can only be accessed by members with permission.
                     Network members control what information each organization or member may see, and what actions each can take.
                      Blockchain is sometimes called a “trustless” network — not because business partners don’t trust each other, but because 
                      they don’t have to.<br>

                    This trust is built on blockchain’s enhanced security, greater transparency, and instant traceability. 
                    Beyond matters of trust, blockchain delivers even more business benefits, including the cost savings
                    from increased speed, efficiency, and automation. By greatly reducing paperwork and errors, blockchain
                    significantly reduces overhead and transaction costs, and reduces or eliminates the need for third parties
                    or middlemen to verify transactions.
